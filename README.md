# PCR_Experiment_Setup
A Shiny app to integrate dynamic experimental conditions, sample metadata, and freezer inventory

## General workflow

### Purpose
The purpose of this app is to integrate several separate but related sets of information to make experimental design, finding samples, and updating sample information in a laboratory information management system (LIMS).

This app takes two inputs:
1. A .csv file that contains a list of samples to be run as well as unique conditions (dilution and volume) for each sample
2. An .xlsx inventory export
